# MateSignal

**MateSignal** is a Forge **client-side mod** that enables cross-interaction with **MateEngine**.

**MateEngine** is a 3D Desktop Avatar Application that lets you display your favorite 3D or VTuber models on your PC.  
It includes features like **dancing**, **window sitting**, and many other fun interactions.  
This mod acts as a **bridge between Minecraft and MateEngine**.

### What it does

During various in-game events such as:
- Crafting  
- Weather changes  
- Nearby mobs  
- Sleeping  
- Day/Night cycle changes  
- Low health or hunger  

…the avatar will display **cute messages on your desktop**.  
For example, when you go to sleep in Minecraft, the 3D mascot will cheerfully say *“Good night!”*.

---

### Usage Warning

Do **not** use this mod on public or competitive servers.  
The avatar can say things like *“Heyyy!! There’s a creeper behind you!!”* which might be considered **cheating** on some servers.  
Use this mod **only** in **singleplayer** or **private multiplayer** worlds with friends.

### Technical Note

If the mod doesn’t work:
- Ensure **port 32145** is open in your firewall.  
- Make sure **TCP and UDP** traffic is properly forwarded.  
  The mod runs a **local server** on your local IP to communicate securely with MateEngine.

### Additional Info

MateEngine itself is written in **C#** using the **Unity Engine**, and it is **open-source and free**.  
(Just in case any CurseForge staff gets worried about “advertising,” don’t worry — it’s a free project.)
